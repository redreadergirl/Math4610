On February 25, 1991, a US Patriot Missile was sent to intercept an Iraqi Scud missile. The patriot missed the scud, which crashed into Army barracks killing 28 US soldiers.
Calculations were performed to determine when the Scud would reach a location but due to machine precision the calculations were slightly off, causing the Patriot to fail at intercepting the missile.
This precision error was corrected in some parts of the code, but not all, therefore the inaccuracies where unable to cancel out. The Patriot had been in the air for over 100 hours so the small bit of error in the calculation was multiplied greatly, causing the missiles to fail to intercept.
