a. The equation for the approximate derivative and the conjugate equation converged after about 20 iterations.
When h < 3.55271e-15 the approximate derivative equation started to change. By h < 1.11022e-16 it was saying the root was 0.
The conjugate equation remained constant after it converged.

b. Both the equation for the approximate derivative and the Taylor series expansion converged and then started get farther from the correct root.
The Taylor series expansion never got as close to the root as the approximate derivative equation.
